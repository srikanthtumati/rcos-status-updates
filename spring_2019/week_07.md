## Last Week's Accomplishments

Created simpleParser.py which reads credentials.json and provides program files with items such as API keys and database passwords.
I also had to update provisionSchema.py and Scraper.py to utilize simpleParser instead of either depending on hardcoded strings for API keys or depending on command line arguements for the database password.


## This Week's Plan

Work on documenting the entire project. This will allow future code development to be faster. I would also like to create a highlevel README that would essentially summarzie the program flow and exactly how the program functions. 

I will also look into creating a REST API as we will need one to collect data from the database to place into graphs on our websites to show for our presentation.

## Anything Blocking?

There is nothing blocking me.

## Notes

Github is glitching and somehow my commits are showing under a different github account of mine (arangetramvrl). I showed this to a mentor (Varun) but we were unable to find out why this was occuring so all future commits will most likely occur under this undername (arangetramvrl). Additionally, while I was performing git commands in the terminal, something crazy happened when I tried to redo a git pull (as the git pull origin deleted one of my local files) and the next time I pushed, duplicate/several commits occurred when I pushed only once. This was NOT intentional and this made my 2/3 large commits seperate into 5 small commits on GitHub.
