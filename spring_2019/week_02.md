## Last Week's Accomplishments

I began reading up on databases and I hope to complete the entire tutorial in this week. (The website I am looking at is https://www.techonthenet.com/postgresql/index.php).

Additionally, an updated web scraper (that is almost functional) was pushed and I began looking at it and began creating additional tests for it.

## This Week's Plan

This week, my highest priority is to finish creating tests for the updated web scraper.

I would also like to continue reading on databases and perhaps create my own small data-scraping project as a means to improve my knowledge on the subject. My idea for the project is an app that tracks plane ticket prices for a certain time period (perhaps past year) and allows a user to compare historical data for certain carriers, locations, and so on. My goal for this is to allow the user to find the cheapest time to buy a plane ticket for a certain destination.

Finally, I would like to perhaps try working on a small feature for Hedgehogs as well to become familar with Django. 

## Anything Blocking?

There is nothing blocking me this week and consequently, I have high hopes for what I am able to achieve this week.

## Notes

I was not feeling well this week and also had 3 exams to prepare for so that severely limited the amount of work I could complete.
