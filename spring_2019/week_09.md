## Last Week's Accomplishments

Finished watching a beginners Flask tutorial and began working on the demo. I have the basics working such as /index, /about, etc...
I also started working on registration/login though that will take some database work.
I also started looking into how we can plot graphs from matplotlib on the website using Flask

## This Week's Plan

Work on the Powerpoint for our presentation. This will involve listing my commits and adding details about my contributions from the semester.
I also plan to work on the demo and the two main features I would like to work by Friday are the login feature and the matplotlib feature. If there is not enough time, I will prioritize the graphing feature as that is more related to the project and try to finish the user/login feature before the end of the semester.


## Anything Blocking?

There is nothing blocking me.
