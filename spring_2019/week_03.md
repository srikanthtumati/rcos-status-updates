## Last Week's Accomplishments

I  continued learning about databases this week. Additionally, I began looking into Django as I am interested in that and hope to work on a task involving that in the project in the future.

Additionally, I pushed my first tests to github for the current data collector that gathers data from sec.gov and converts it into excel files.

## This Week's Plan

This week, my highest priority is to get my doubts cleared for the provisionSchema file and try to start working on it.

Additionally, as some of the other team members pushed a scraper that uses a seperate API to collect company data, I would like to use PyTest to create some tests for that as well.

I would like to work on another side on the project other than testing so I hope learning about Django will allow me to work on something like user authentication.

## Anything Blocking?

It has been a couple weeks since we had a team meeting. Hoping to have one this week as I have some questions for the next task.
