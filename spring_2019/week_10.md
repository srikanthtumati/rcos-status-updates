## Last Week's Accomplishments

This week I reached my goal and got the website working for the presentation. The website currently allows for the user to input any company ticker (that is currently in the S&P 500) and choose from one of four stock charts (open, close, low, high). I enjoyed working on this a lot as I ended up liking Flask and plan to use it in a future project. Additionally, it was fun learning a little CSS. It took a long time to make the footer be sticky instead of fixed so I think that is something that will definitely help down the line. I also began working on the user login/logout implementation as well.

## This Week's Plan

One of my goals for this week is to add some additional touches to the Flask website (adding text to the homepage and 'About' page). It may take some time to work on graphics and a good design for the homepage.

I would also like to finish working on the user login/logout implementation. I have already created the User class and began looking into the extensions needed for Flask as out of the box, Flask does not allow for complete user logins. 

Lastly, I plan to document the front end so it will be easier for future developers to understand the code. 

## Anything Blocking?

There is nothing blocking me.
