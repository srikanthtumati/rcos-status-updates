## Last Week's Accomplishments

I properly documented provisionSchema and pushed it to GitHub.
Additionally, I read up on Schemas and Tables and began working on the SQL code to create a schema and have each company have its own table in the schema with its stock data

## This Week's Plan

Finish provisionSchema and the SQL code needed to create the tables for the companies.

Connect the WebScraper with provisionSchema so the program is able to collect data and create the appropriate tables and place the data into the tables all in one go.

## Anything Blocking?

There is nothing blocking me.
