## Last Week's Accomplishments

I began making myself familiar with PyTest and started creating appropriate tests for the web scraping portion of the projects. 

Additionally, I began writing a tutorial for PyTest in Google Docs as a means to quickly resource useful commands and have a central location for everything that I need.

Lastly, I began reading up on databases to understand how they work (and also begin to understand how the database is incorporated into the project). 

## This Week's Plan

This week, my highest priority is to get a deeper understanding of the program flow and see the purpose of each file. In turn, this will allow me to create more complex tests and analyze more critical functions/methods for the program. 

I would also like to continue reading on databases and perhaps create my own small data-scraping project as a means to improve my knowledge on the subject and potentially work on that side of hedgehogs in the coming weeks.

Finally, I would like to create some tests for the data scraping that a couple of the other team members were working on if possible.

## Anything Blocking?

The only blocker is that I am unsure of the program flow (as there is not much documentation in the code) and this tremendously hinders my progress when creating tests as it is important (if not necessary) to understand the role of each file to create useful tests that test edge cases and so on.
