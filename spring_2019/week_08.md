## Last Week's Accomplishments

Worked on connecting simpleParser with provisionSchema so we are able to create tables in the database (and schema) and then fill the database with one python script
Also began working on demo for the presentation (using search bar on website, calling scraper, using matplotlib to display stock data on website)

## This Week's Plan

I would like to begin Work on the JavaScript code for the website that will update website on the client side once the Python Script generates an image (of the stock data).
Additionally, after we get the image to display and such, I will need to document the new code. Lastly, I am looking into REST APIs and still deciding whether it would be better
to create an API or simply create the demo using JavaScript.

## Anything Blocking?

There is nothing blocking me.
