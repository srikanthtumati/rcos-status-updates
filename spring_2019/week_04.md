## Last Week's Accomplishments

I worked a lot on one of the database setup scripts (provisionSchema.py) and it is almost complete.
This file runs at the beginning of the program flow and initializes the database to have the prpoer tables and schema for the web scraper to place data into.

## This Week's Plan

I would like to work on another side on the project other than testing so I hope learning about Django will allow me to work on something like user authentication.

I am also trying to learn about trading algorithms as the next step will involve creating some basic trading algorithms that is based on the data that the web scraper collects.

## Anything Blocking?

There is nothing blocking me.
